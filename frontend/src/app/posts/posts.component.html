            sat silent and looked at poor Alice, who felt ready to sink into the earth. At last the Gryphon said to the Mock
            Turtle, 'Drive on, old fellow! Don't be all day about it!' and he went on in these words: 'Yes, we went to school
            in the sea, though you mayn't believe itâ€”' 'I never said I didn't!' interrupted Alice. 'You did,' said the Mock
            Turtle.
